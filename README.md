# GOHOMA

This prototype is a web-application to motivate housebound people to solve challenges against oneanother.

## Details
When people have to stay in a small place they tend to become listless and sluggish.
To interrupt this lethargy the user will be activated to solve challenges against themselves, friends and others.
